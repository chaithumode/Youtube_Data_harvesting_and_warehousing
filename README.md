# Introduction
YouTube, the online video-sharing platform, has revolutionized the way we consume and interact with media. Launched in 2005, it has grown into a global phenomenon, serving as a hub for entertainment, education, and community engagement. With its vast user base and diverse content library, YouTube has become a powerful tool for individuals, creators, and businesses to share their stories, express themselves, and connect with audiences worldwide.

This project extracts the particular youtube channel data by using the youtube channel id, processes the data, and stores it in the MongoDB database. It has the option to migrate the data to MySQL from MongoDB then analyse the data and give the results depending on the customer questions.

## 4. E T L Process
a) Extract data
Extract the particular youtube channel data by using the youtube channel id, with the help of the youtube API developer console.
b) Process and Transform the data
After the extraction process, takes the required details from the extraction data and transform it into JSON format.
c) Load data
After the transformation process, the JSON format data is stored in the MongoDB database, also It has the option to migrate the data to MySQL database from the MongoDB database.
5. E D A Process and Framework
a) Access MySQL DB
Create a connection to the MySQL server and access the specified MySQL DataBase by using pymysql library and access tables.
b) Filter the data
Filter and process the collected data from the tables depending on the given requirements by using SQL queries and transform the processed data into a DataFrame format.
c) Visualization
Finally, create a Dashboard by using Streamlit and give dropdown options on the Dashboard to the user and select a question from that menu to analyse the data and show the output in Dataframe Table and Bar chart.
